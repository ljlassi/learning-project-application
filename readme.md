PHP learning project

BACKGROUND:

I haven't done enough stuff with plain PHP recently so I figured out I might as well do something now. The plan is to make an application here and then build a microservice and integrate this with the microservice. This is a very quickly done project too, one of my goals is to test my efficiency in producing plain-PHP back-end code.

DISCLAIMER:

Code is not meant to be used as itself by others, I take no responsibility for anything regarding this. You can however use this for learning purposes.
